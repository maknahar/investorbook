# Getting started

## Demo Link

You can view a live demo of the webclient at:

https://investorbook.herokuapp.com/

## Postgress Access

You can use this URI to connect to Postgres directly:

`postgres://postgres:vrqLs08CazD0j6l8@35.194.8.164:5432`

## Hasura Access

If you would prefer to use a GraphQL API, you can use this endpoint:

https://electric-kangaroo-87.hasura.app/v1/graphql

## Webclient Sample App

If you have docker and docker-compose installed on your system, you can start
the sample webclient with `docker-compose up`. The address will be
http://localhost:3001.

If you prefer, you can instead run `yarn install` and `yarn start` in the
`webclient/` subdirectory.
